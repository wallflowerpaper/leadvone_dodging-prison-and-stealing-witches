    <p>Welcome to Book Three of Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.</p>

    <p>One thing before we start⁠ ...</p>

    <p>I’ve said before that I use my fanfiction as a kind of self-directed apprenticeship in writing⁠—a place where I can experiment with new styles and techniques in a moderately risk free environment. Right now, I’m working on how to write novels in series, so I’m not going to give you the same info dump recap at the start of this book as I did at the start of book two. Instead, I intend for the books from here on out to be reasonably self contained, so that a reader doesn’t have to reread the whole story all over again to understand what’s going on (unless they want to, of course).</p>

    <p>And now⁠ ⁠...</p>
